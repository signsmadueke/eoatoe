      <description>The Church exists to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the mind of God, as revealed in His Word to the world.

      <title>Building Healthy Relationships, Emmanuel Atoe, Christian Author of over 100 books on Amazon</title>
      <link>https://eoatoe.com/newbook?book=building-healthy-relationships</link>
      <description>Relationships are what life is made of; we form them by what we do, how we do it, and what we represent. When God first made humanity, He formed relationships and created a good atmosphere for Adam and Eve to assist one another, but unfortunately, because of human sin, this became difficult. Relationships come in many different forms; however, this book focuses on promoting healthy couple relationships. When it comes to relationships, everyone has different perceptions, and they also react differently when facing challenges. Differences in lifestyle and exposure and even Christian homes can create relationship issues. Healthy relationships are fostered by properly addressing problems and conflicts in the proper manner. God's principle is that people should respond to their differences in a Biblical way and use their disagreements to promote growth and development. The primary factor is for the couple to cohabitate in love....</description>

      <title>Wisdom For Your Best Life, Emmanuel Atoe, Christian Author of over 100 books on Amazon</title>
      <link>https://eoatoe.com/newbook?book=wisdom-for-your-best-life</link>
      <description>God�s wisdom is an essential tool in the journey of every believer. The Bible contrasts wisdom from above, which seeks to please God and is fulfilling, from earthly wisdom, which is self-seeking and leads to ruin. The indispensability of wisdom is underscored by the biblical saying, �Wisdom is the principal thing� and �In all your getting, get wisdom.� In �Wisdom for Your Best Life�, Dr Emmanuel Atoe reveals that those who follow God�s wisdom succeed in life and enjoy all-round fulfilment. He teaches you how to get divine wisdom, use it to reign in life and fulfil your destiny. Highly enriching, this book provides copious examples of the immense value of God�s wisdom as used by different characters in the Bible. Get God�s wisdom and reign in life!...</description>

      <description>Scripture Reading Galatians 3:13-29    Key Verse And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. Genesis 21:5-6 Friend, What Abraham gave to Isaac was the covenant blessings, the Bible says: Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, If Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac, where did he got the one he gave to the sons of the concubines? What Abraham gave to the sons of the concubines were material things: like cars, house, factory etc but to Isaac, everything that made him Abraham was given to Isaac, remember he was Abram but for covenant relationship with God he became Abraham and it was everything about the covenant relationship with the details of the covenant was transferred to Isaac. You are into the same covenant and you have access to the deta...</description>
